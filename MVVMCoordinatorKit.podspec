  s.description      = <<-DESC
This Kit aims to speed up your development and help you organize Screens into coherent flows that are easily reusable using the Coordinator pattern, making navigation between screens simple and readable.

This Kit also helps you create UIViewController (the View in the MVVM pattern) and its ViewModel.

Model is not part of this Kit, as it is up to the developers to define their models in the app.
